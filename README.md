# Personal Knowledge Base

## How to use this repository
1. There are two folders, `personal` and `software_engineering`.
2. `personal` contains notes that are related to personal development/self-improvement. Where as `software-engineering`.
3. Each subject in either categories should get it's own file for now. When more notes are written and files become too large, I will then create policies to further breakdown files into various folders and other files.
